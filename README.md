# Interstellar-Expedition
 A 3D space exploration game written in GLSL, where players can control a spaceship using the keyboard (WASD) to navigate between different planets in the universe. The project utilizes extensive CG rendering techniques, including 3D modeling of the spacecraft and detailed planetary features.
 
Please use Visual Studio Code and install the Live Server extension and use the Five Server to test the demo HTML file. 

The project was collaboratively developed by the group from the Advanced Course in Computer Graphics at Waseda University. 

The team division of work is as follows:
YU YUANYONG: Responsible for project idea conception, assisting with embedding the spaceship model into the background, functionality debugging, error fixing, and project testing.
CHEN MEIZE: Responsible for spaceship model creation, starry background, and primary feature coding such as spaceship exhaust flames, meteors, and collision detection.
Other members: Responsible for planet modeling and some details of the starry background(Milky Way background).
All team members participated in the writing of the report and the preparation of the project presentation PPT.

Since the other team members do not have GitHub accounts, the project source code is hosted on my GitHub account.
Thanks to all team members for their hard work and dedication.
