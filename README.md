# Interstellar-Expedition
 A 3D space exploration game written in GLSL, where players can control a spaceship using the keyboard (WASD) to navigate between different planets in the universe. The project utilizes extensive CG rendering techniques, including 3D modeling of the spacecraft and detailed planetary features.
 
Please use Visual Studio Code, install the Live Server extension, and use the Five Server to test the demo HTML file. 

The group from the Advanced Course in Computer Graphics at Waseda University collaboratively developed the project. 

The team division of work is as follows:

YU YUANYONG: Responsible for embedding the spaceship model and putting together the scene, functionality debugging, model feature error fixing(Spaceship model clipping issues, key bindings, camera position adjustments), and project testing.

CHEN MEIZE: Responsible for spaceship model creation, starry background, and primary feature coding such as spaceship exhaust flames, meteors, and collision detection.

MASAYA TAKABE and Riku Nakashima are responsible for planet modeling and some details of the starry background(Milky Way background).

Since the other team members do not have GitHub accounts, the project source code is hosted on this GitHub account.
Thanks to all team members for their hard work and dedication.
